# Digital Asset Monitor

## Description

This is a minimalist, all-in-one information hub regarding the top digital assets. Most applications are geared toward professional traders, saturated with an overwhelming amount of data for a newcomer or even just your average investor. 

As someone who isn’t a professional trader, I don’t need all of the technical analysis data. I want a clear and concise interface that gives me information relevant to my interests so that I can stay up-to-date without investing a ton of time.

“Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the Universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up."  - Stephen Hawking
